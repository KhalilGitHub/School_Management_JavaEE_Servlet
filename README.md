Description:
===========
This is the Java EE Version of the Project to develop an application that allows the management of the
Schools. Although I have a background in Java and C # Programming Language, Currently at the beginning 
I am Researcher in Software, Web and Android Coding.

This application can perform:

	1 - The steps of registering a student.
	2 - Retrieving information about enrolling a student through an Explorer interface
	3 - Save the data in a database.


Java Tiled Programming Language Technologies to perform these tasks are:

	- Enter data into a Registration Form.
	- Form designed by Java EE Techology.
	- Using the JSP and Java Servlet Technique.
	- In my Code I used:
	- OOP (Java Programming Oriented Object).
	- The inheritance (Class inheritance).
	- The List of Tables (Arrylist).
